# Video Summarization Tool

This project provides a tool for summarizing videos by converting them into text, summarizing the text, and translating it into Turkish. The process uses state-of-the-art machine learning models, including OpenAI Whisper for transcription and the Transformers library for summarization.

## Features

•⁠  ⁠Convert MP4 video files to MP3 audio files.
•⁠  ⁠Transcribe audio files into text using Whisper.
•⁠  ⁠Summarize transcribed text using the Transformers library.
•⁠  ⁠Translate the summarized text into Turkish using Google Translate.
•⁠  ⁠Display and save both English and Turkish summaries.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

•⁠  ⁠Python 3.7 or later
•⁠  ⁠Virtual environment set up (recommended)
•⁠  ⁠Required Python libraries

## Installation

1.⁠ ⁠Clone the repository:
   ⁠ bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_folder>
    ⁠

2.⁠ ⁠Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ⁠ bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ⁠

3.⁠ ⁠Install the required libraries:
   ⁠ bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
    ⁠

## Usage

1.⁠ ⁠Run the application:
   ⁠ bash
   python main.py
    ⁠

2.⁠ ⁠Use the GUI to upload an MP4 video file.

3.⁠ ⁠The tool will:
   - Convert the video to audio (MP3).
   - Transcribe the audio to text.
   - Summarize the text.
   - Translate the summary into Turkish.

4.⁠ ⁠The English and Turkish summaries will be displayed in the GUI and saved as ⁠ summary.txt ⁠ and ⁠ summary_tr.txt ⁠, respectively.

## Notes

•⁠  ⁠This project is designed to run in a Python virtual environment.
•⁠  ⁠Ensure you have ⁠ ffmpeg ⁠ installed and available in your system's PATH for audio conversion.
•⁠  ⁠Internet access is required for Google Translate and the Hugging Face API.
